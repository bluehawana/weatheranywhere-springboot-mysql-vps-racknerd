# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical mobile responsiveness issues and theme switching problems in the WeatherAnywhere application. Currently, when users access the application on mobile devices and search for cities like "Sanya" or "Hawaii", the weather results and SVG graphics overflow off-screen, making the application unusable on smaller screens. Additionally, the theme switching logic is not working correctly - it should display a white theme during daytime hours (08:00-18:00) and a dark theme during nighttime hours (18:00-07:00) based on the user's local time, but currently defaults to dark theme. The marketing text also incorrectly states "No Java" when this is actually a Java-based project.

## Glossary

- **WeatherAnywhere Application**: The web-based weather information system that displays weather data for user-specified cities
- **Theme System**: The visual styling mechanism that switches between white (daytime) and dark (nighttime) color schemes
- **Mobile Viewport**: Screen sizes typically below 768px width, including smartphones and small tablets
- **Weather Results Container**: The HTML div element (#weatherDiv) that displays fetched weather information
- **SVG Graphics**: Scalable Vector Graphics elements used to display weather icons and visual representations
- **Local Time**: The current time in the user's timezone as reported by their browser

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the weather results and graphics to fit within my screen, so that I can view all weather information without horizontal scrolling or content being cut off

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the WeatherAnywhere Application on a mobile device with viewport width less than 768px, THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL apply responsive CSS styles to ensure all content fits within the viewport width
2. WHEN weather results are displayed in the Weather Results Container on a mobile device, THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL scale and reflow the content to prevent horizontal overflow
3. WHEN SVG Graphics are rendered on a mobile device, THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL constrain the SVG width to a maximum of 100% of the parent container width
4. WHEN a user views the weather information on a screen width of 375px or less, THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL adjust font sizes and padding to maintain readability without content overflow
5. WHEN ASCII art elements are displayed on mobile devices, THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL either hide them or scale them appropriately to prevent layout breaking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user accessing the site during daytime hours, I want to see a white background with black text by default, so that the interface is comfortable to read in bright conditions

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the WeatherAnywhere Application between 08:00 and 17:59 Local Time, THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL display a white background with black text
2. WHEN a user accesses the WeatherAnywhere Application between 18:00 and 07:59 Local Time, THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL display a black background with white text
3. WHEN the Theme System initializes on page load, THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL read the user's Local Time from the browser and apply the appropriate theme within 100 milliseconds
4. WHEN the Local Time crosses the 08:00 or 18:00 threshold while the page is open, THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL automatically switch themes within 60 seconds
5. THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL default to white theme if the Theme System fails to determine Local Time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor reading the marketing copy, I want accurate information about the technology stack, so that I understand what the application is built with

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL display marketing text that does not reference "No Java" since the application is built with Java
2. THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL display marketing text that accurately represents the technology stack or uses generic retro-themed messaging
3. WHEN a user views the homepage, THE WeatherAnywhere Application SHALL show updated marketing copy that maintains the 90s retro aesthetic while being technically accurate
